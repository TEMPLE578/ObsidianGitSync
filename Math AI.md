##### **Accuracy of measurement measurement is only accurate to +-1/2 of the smallest unit given**
##### **For example:**
72cm the lowest number is 1 what is half of 1? 1/2cm or 0,5
so 72.5 is upper bound and 71.5 is lower bound and if for example
72.9cm exists its +- 0.05
72.85 to 72.95 cm

##### **A rectangular board was measured as 78cm by 24cm find the boundary values for its perimeter**
L + L + W + W
2L + 2W
77.5+77.5+23.5+23.5 = 202cm
78.5+78.5+24.5+24.5 = 206cm

##### **A paving brick is measured as 18cm by 10cm. what are the boundary values for its area?**
18.5 x 10.5 = 194.25cm
17.5 x 9.6 = 166.25cm


## Exponent loss or exponent rules
The exponent rules are: Product of powers rule — Add powers together when multiplying like bases. Quotient of powers rule — Subtract powers when dividing like bases. Power of powers rule — Multiply powers together when raising a power by another exponent.
