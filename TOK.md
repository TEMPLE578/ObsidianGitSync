Theory of knowledge

Knowledge framework - what you already know at one level.

Areas of knowledge - natural sciences, human sciences, history, and arts.

- Themes - knowledge on politics, technology, language, religion and societies.

Knowledge Questions - questions that don't have a definitive answer and tend to be open-ended.

4 something's of knowledge

Scope - What did you once believe in but no longer do? Why? What does that tell you about yourself?

Perspectives - How do you navigate the tri-focal perspectives of yourself as an individual, as a member of a species? A member of a group? What does it mean it so say "We all have many names."

Methods and tools - How do you use social media to educate yourself? As a knower in a dispute, what is your first line of defence? Can we count on our feelings or intuition for knowledge?

Ethics - How wide is the net you use to cast your ethical concerns? What opinions do you hold on those who call people 'losers'?

Claims
- if we want to have an intelligent and informative discussion. 

Give provisional definitions

Be as clear as possible 

In spiritual discourse, very easy to use terms like love and God and assuming everybody knows what you mean. 

Dogmatic closes you to the possibility of being wrong. Open yourself up to learning by admitting that you might be wrong or that you might not know everything.
