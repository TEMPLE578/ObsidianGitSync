## **metric prefixes**
metric prefixes are abbreviations in front of a unit that specifies the power of ten for the quantity

uncertainty needs to be 1 significant figure


Sin is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse, cos is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse, and tan is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side
Vectors 

Adding and subtracting vectors - HEAD to TAIL

Worked Example

Find (a) A + B and (b) B - A

Components of a Vector

Ax = A cos 0
Ay = A sin 0

Approximate uncertainty for a range of values using

Uncertainty for a range of values

Half the limit of the reading is often used unless the imcertaitmy of the range is larger

Determine the average of the temperature of values given:
44 45 46 47

45.4

Determine uncertainty for the range of temperatures
